# Weather Dashboard

## The Short Version:
A simple weather dashboard working from the US.

## More in-depth user control:
The application allows you to: 
 * view the current time as a header
 * set notes and save them to local storage by clicking the 'save' icon
 * color coded blocks makes scheduling easy!

## What's it look like?
